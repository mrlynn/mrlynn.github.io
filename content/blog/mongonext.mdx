    B -->|Yes| C[Session]
    B -->|No| D[Error]
    C --> E[Protected Routes]
    end
    
    subgraph "User Management"
    F[Register] --> G[Email Verify]
    G --> H[Profile]
    H --> I[Password Reset]
    end

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: App Router Migration

Migrating from the Pages Router to the App Router required careful consideration of authentication and layout patterns.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented middleware for authentication
- Created a flexible layout system
- Used React Server Components where appropriate
- Maintained client-side interactivity where needed

### Challenge 2: Theme System

Creating a robust theme system that works across the entire application.

**Solution**:
- Implemented Material UI's theme provider
- Created theme context for dynamic switching
- Added CSS variables for custom properties
- Ensured consistent styling across components

### Challenge 3: Authentication Flow

Building a secure and user-friendly authentication system.

**Solution**:
- Integrated NextAuth.js with MongoDB
- Added email verification
- Implemented password reset flow
- Created protected route middleware
- Added role-based access control

## Future Enhancements

Several exciting features are planned:

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Enhanced admin interface
2. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration
3. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Deployment Templates**: Ready-to-use deployment configs
5. **More Auth Providers**: Additional social login options
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in analytics

## Conclusion

MongoNext provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications. By combining Next.js, MongoDB, and Material UI with best practices and ready-to-use features, it significantly reduces development time and ensures a professional result.
