### Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a go-to strategy for building smarter AI systems - ones that can pull in external knowledge instead of hallucinating facts. And while most of the buzz centers around fancy embedding models and powerful LLMs, there's one surprisingly underrated component that can make or break a RAG system: how you chunk your documents.

In this post, we'll take a closer look at the full RAG chunking lifecycle - from slicing up documents to generating a final response - and show how thoughtful chunking can dramatically improve AI output quality.

### What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) brings together two superpowers: large language models and external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying only on what the model "remembers," a RAG system actively looks things up in a knowledge base and feeds the relevant context into the model to generate a response.

![RAG Pipeline Diagram](/images/blog/rag-pipeline.png)

Here's how the RAG pipeline generally flows:

- **Chunking** – Break documents into smaller, useful pieces  
- **Embedding** – Turn those chunks into vector representations  
- **Retrieval** – Find the chunks most relevant to a given query  
- **Generation** – Craft a response using the retrieved chunks

It's simple in theory. In practice? The devil's in the chunking.

### Why chunking matters

Every step in the pipeline plays a role, but chunking is the one that quietly influences everything downstream. Done right, you get great relevance and performance. Done wrong, and you're left with vague, irrelevant, or just plain confusing answers.

Why chunking is critical:

- LLMs have relatively short attention spans (aka token limits)  
- Better chunks = better retrieval (semantic matching thrives on coherence)  
- Messy chunks = lost meaning  
- Efficient chunks = faster, smarter systems

### The RAG chunking lifecycle

Let's break down the lifecycle and walk through each phase.

#### Stage 1: Document chunking

This is where it all begins - taking raw documents and chopping them into digestible chunks. Your strategy here has ripple effects all the way down the line.

Common approaches:

1. **No Chunking**  
     
   - *Pros:* Full context preserved  
   - *Cons:* Too much content for specific queries

   

2. **Fixed-Size Chunking**  
     
   - *Pros:* Simple, predictable  
   - *Cons:* Can split ideas awkwardly

   

3. **Delimiter-Based Chunking**  
     
   - *Pros:* Honors natural breaks  
   - *Cons:* Uneven chunk sizes

   

4. **Recursive Chunking**  
     
   - *Pros:* Flexible, structure-aware  
   - *Cons:* Slightly more complex

   

5. **Semantic Chunking**  
     
   - *Pros:* Keeps related ideas together  
   - *Cons:* Requires deeper processing (LLM-based or embedding-based)

##### Tools and Libraries to Make This Easier

While rolling your own chunking logic gives you fine-grained control, several libraries can help you move faster and handle more complex use cases:

- **LangChain** – Comes with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, `TokenTextSplitter`, and more. Easy to use, production-tested.  
- **LlamaIndex** – Offers advanced semantic chunking with `SemanticSplitterNodeParser` using LLMs.  
- **Unstructured.io** – Great for extracting content from real-world formats (PDFs, HTML, DOCX) into clean, structured chunks.  
- **spaCy / NLTK** – Traditional NLP tools for sentence/paragraph/token splitting. Still great for rule-based chunking.

##### Should semantic chunking use an LLM?

Yes - if you want the best semantic boundaries. LLM-based chunking can:

- Interpret the text's meaning  
- Segment based on conceptual breaks (not just formatting)  
- Preserve context that traditional methods might split apart

Common approaches include:

- Prompting an LLM to segment content  
- Using embeddings and clustering  
- Using paragraph boundaries as a proxy (still common in practice)

In production RAG pipelines, teams often start with simple heuristics (like paragraph breaks) and evolve toward semantic LLM-powered methods as they scale and tune for quality.

#### Stage 2: Vector embedding

Each chunk gets turned into a high-dimensional vector - basically a mathematical fingerprint of its meaning. Tools like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` take care of this.

Considerations:

- **Model quality** – Better models = better representations  
- **Dimensions** – More dimensions can mean richer context, but also more storage  
- **Garbage in, garbage out** – Better chunks yield better vectors

#### Stage 3: Vector retrieval

When the user asks a question, it's vectorized and compared to stored embeddings to find the closest matches. This is where MongoDB Atlas Vector Search comes in - with fast, efficient similarity search.

Key factors:

- **Similarity metric** – Cosine is common, but not your only option  
- **k-NN tuning** – How many chunks should you return?  
- **Re-ranking** – Adjust scores post-retrieval  
- **Filtering** – Metadata-based filters narrow the field

#### Stage 4: Response generation

Retrieved chunks are compiled into a prompt for the LLM. The better the context, the better the final output.

Tips for this step:

- **Prompt formatting** – Structure the context clearly  
- **Explicit instructions** – Tell the model what you want  
- **Source tracking** – Keep receipts if citations matter  
- **Output clarity** – Format for readability

### Chunking in action: demo time

To test how chunking impacts output, I built a [small RAG demo app](https://rag-chunk-explainer.vercel.app) using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and OpenAI. It lets you toggle between chunking strategies and compare results.

**Example Query:** "What equipment is provided for remote workers?"

- **Fixed-size chunking (200 characters):** Retrieved equipment mentions, but missed policy context. Accurate, but not complete.  
- **Semantic chunking:** Nailed it. Retrieved the full policy section with all relevant details. The response was rich and clear.

Moral of the story? Chunking isn't just setup - it directly shapes your results.

### Best practices for chunking

Here's what we've learned works well:

1. Start with structure – Understand your document layout  
2. Preserve meaning – Don't split mid-thought  
3. Test chunk sizes – One size rarely fits all  
4. Overlap chunks – Helps preserve context across boundaries  
5. Tag everything – Metadata improves filtering and relevance  
6. Use hierarchy – Nested chunking for structured content  
7. Monitor & refine – Let real results guide improvements

### Sample Code for Chunking

Below are example functions from our app's `chunking.js` utility:

```javascript
export function chunkByDelimiter(text, delimiter) {
  return text.split(delimiter).filter(chunk => chunk.trim());
}

export function chunkByFixedSize(text, chunkSize, overlap) {
  const chunks = [];
  let i = 0;
  while (i < text.length) {
    chunks.push(text.slice(i, i + chunkSize));
    i += chunkSize - overlap;
  }
  return chunks;
}

export function recursiveChunk(text, maxSize, overlap) {
  const chunks = [];
  let start = 0;
  while (start < text.length) {
    let end = Math.min(start + maxSize, text.length);
    let breakPoint = text.lastIndexOf('.', end);
    if (breakPoint <= start) breakPoint = end;
    chunks.push(text.slice(start, breakPoint + 1));
    start = breakPoint - overlap;
  }
  return chunks;
}

export function semanticChunk(text) {
  const sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]+/g) || [text];
  const chunks = [];
  let current = '';
  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    if (current.length + sentence.length > 100) {
      chunks.push(current);
      current = sentence;
    } else {
      current += sentence;
    }
  }
  if (current) chunks.push(current);
  return chunks;
}
```

### Conclusion

Chunking may not be glamorous, but it's essential. It's the quiet force behind high-quality retrieval and generation in RAG systems. Choose wisely, experiment often, and monitor results.
