# Design Reviewer

## Overview
Design Reviewer is an innovative AI-powered system that revolutionizes the design review process by automatically analyzing design files and providing actionable feedback based on established design systems and best practices. This tool helps teams maintain consistency across their design assets while reducing the time spent on manual reviews.

## Features
- **Automated Design Analysis**: Instantly scan design files for consistency and compliance
- **Best Practice Validation**: Check against established design guidelines
- **Component Library Integration**: Verify usage of approved components
- **Accessibility Checking**: Ensure designs meet WCAG standards
- **Brand Consistency**: Validate against brand guidelines
- **Collaborative Review**: Enable team members to provide feedback
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track design system adoption and compliance

## Technical Details

### Architecture
The application leverages a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js with React and Material UI
- AI Engine: Custom-trained models for design analysis
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for storing design patterns and feedback
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with enterprise SSO

### Key Components
1. **Design Analysis Engine**
   - Pattern recognition for UI components
   - Color scheme validation
   - Typography consistency checking
   - Layout analysis

2. **Feedback System**
   - Inline comments and suggestions
   - Version control integration
   - Automated notifications
   - Review workflow management

3. **Analytics Module**
   - Design system adoption metrics
