# Building Multmodal AI Agents - From Concept to Code

## Event Overview

The second day of our MongoDB Developer Day focuses on cutting-edge AI capabilities. This hands-on workshop will guide you through implementing Vector Search, building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, and creating AI Agents using MongoDB Atlas.

## Session Topics

This hands-on workshop equips you with the skills to create intelligent agents that seamlessly process both visual and textual information, a critical capability for next-generation applications.

Discover why multimodal agents represent a quantum leap beyond simple prompting and RAG systems, with concrete examples of how they solve previously intractable problems in document processing and visual reasoning. Through practical demonstration, we deconstruct the four pillars of effective agent architecture: perception, planning/reasoning, tools, and memory.

The workshop reveals breakthrough approaches to mixed-modality document handling, showcasing how modern VLM-based embedding models overcome traditional limitations while dramatically simplifying implementation pipelines.

You'll build a multimodal agent using Python, Gemini 2.5, and MongoDB that can: - Answer complex questions about documents containing interleaved text and visuals - Explain charts and diagrams with human-like reasoning - Maintain conversational context across multiple interactions

This isn't theoretical, you'll leave with working code you can immediately adapt for your projects, saving weeks of development time. Whether you're building customer-facing applications or internal tools, these techniques provide a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
