# MongoDB Developer Day Dallas

## Event Overview

Join us for an immersive, hands-on developer experience in Dallas! Our expert instructors will guide you through essential topics across two dynamic days of learning. Choose to attend either day based on your interests, or join us for the full event to maximize your technical expertise.

## Day 1: RDBMS to MongoDB

The first day focuses on transitioning from relational databases to MongoDB:

### Data Modeling for RDBMS Professionals
Learn the principles of document-based data modeling and how to migrate a relational database to a MongoDB document model. Discover key similarities and differences between relational and document data models, and translate core relational concepts into a MongoDB document schema. This session also offers the opportunity to earn the Relational vs Document Relationships badge for your LinkedIn profile.

### Moving Data to MongoDB with the Relational Migrator
Learn how to move your workloads from a relational database to MongoDB Atlas, beginning with your database schema and data. You'll use the MongoDB Relational Migrator to connect to a relational database, get a proposed schema for MongoDB, migrate stored procedures, views, and data, and generate code to access newly migrated data.

### From SQL to the MongoDB Query API
Through hands-on exercises, translate your existing RDBMS querying knowledge into new MongoDB Query API skills. Learn basic CRUD operation equivalents, how to create new queries adapted to the document-model patterns, and how to build complex aggregation pipelines to leverage MongoDB server-side data analytic capabilities.

## Day 2: GenAI

The second day explores cutting-edge AI capabilities with MongoDB:

### Introduction to Vector Search
Discover how to enrich your application and power AI capabilities with semantic search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. Learn the core concepts of vector search, gain hands-on experience performing vector search queries against MongoDB collections, and learn how to tune and optimize these queries.

### Building RAG Apps Using MongoDB
Learn how to build a RAG-based AI chatbot with MongoDB Atlas. This two-part workshop covers foundational concepts of RAG systems, including chunking, embedding, and semantic search. Build an end-to-end, RAG-based chatbot using MongoDB Atlas and open-source LLMs.

### The A to Z of Building AI Agents
Learn the core concepts of AI agents, including reasoning, tools, and memory, and explore different agent architectures. Build a MongoDB learning agent that uses MongoDB as the agent's memory and knowledge store, Azure Open AI as the agent's "brain," and LangGraph to orchestrate the end-to-end agentic workflow.

## Design Reviews

If your team is interested in having a MongoDB expert review your application and provide guidance, sign up for a 45-minute design review session. Design reviews focus on driving efficiency at the database layer, with discussions on logical data models using generic entity relationship diagrams. Design a data model in real time and leave with enough knowledge to iterate and optimize the design on your own.
