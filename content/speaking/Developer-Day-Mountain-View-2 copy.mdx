# MongoDB Developer Day Mountain View - AI Focus

## Event Overview

The second day of our MongoDB Developer Day focuses on cutting-edge AI capabilities. This hands-on workshop will guide you through implementing Vector Search, building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, and creating AI Agents using MongoDB Atlas.

## Session Topics

### Vector Search: Beginner to Pro
Learn how to implement semantic search and similarity-based retrieval in your applications using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. This session covers everything from the basics to advanced techniques for optimizing vector search performance.

### Building RAG Apps Using MongoDB
Discover how to create production-ready Retrieval Augmented Generation applications with MongoDB. We'll explore best practices for document ingestion, vector embedding, and integration with large language models to build powerful AI-enhanced applications.

### The A to Z of Building AI Agents
Master the process of building intelligent AI Agents using MongoDB Atlas as the knowledge store. Learn how to design, implement, and optimize AI Agents that can perform complex tasks and provide intelligent responses based on your data.

## Who Should Attend

- Developers building AI-enhanced applications
- Data scientists interested in vector databases
- Software engineers working with LLMs
- Architects designing modern AI applications
- MongoDB users looking to leverage AI capabilities

## Additional Resources

Participants will receive access to:
- Hands-on labs and exercises
- GitHub repositories with sample code
- Technical documentation and best practices guides
- MongoDB Atlas credits for implementing your own AI solutions
