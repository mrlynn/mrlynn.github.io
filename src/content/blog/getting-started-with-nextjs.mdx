# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. It provides a great developer experience with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React applications:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast page loads and reduced server load
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality directly in your Next.js app
- **File-System Based Routing**: Intuitive and easy to understand
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Including CSS Modules and Sass

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will prompt you with some configuration options. Here's what I recommend:

```bash
Would you like to use TypeScript? â€º Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? â€º Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? â€º Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? â€º Yes
Would you like to use App Router? â€º Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? â€º No
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-next-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ next.config.js
```

## Creating Your First Page

In the App Router, pages are created by adding files to the `app` directory. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Adding API Routes

API routes are created by adding files to the `app/api` directory:

```tsx
// src/app/api/hello/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from the API!' });
}
```

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms:

1. **Vercel**: The creators of Next.js offer the best deployment experience
2. **Netlify**: Great for static sites
3. **AWS**: Using services like Amplify or Elastic Beanstalk

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its features and developer experience make it a joy to work with, while its performance optimizations ensure your applications run smoothly.
