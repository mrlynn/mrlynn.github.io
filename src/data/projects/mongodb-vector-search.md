# MongoDB Vector Search

MongoDB Vector Search enables you to store and query vector embeddings alongside your data, making it perfect for semantic search, recommendations, and AI-powered applications.

## Features

- Semantic search capabilities
- Integration with popular embedding models
- Support for multiple similarity metrics
- Efficient vector indexing
- Real-time vector search queries

## Implementation

The implementation showcases how to:
1. Create and manage vector indexes
2. Generate embeddings from text
3. Perform vector similarity searches
4. Implement hybrid search combining vector and traditional queries
5. Build real-world applications using vector search
